# Bayesian-Optimization-of-structure-to-property-mapping-in-materials

A Gaussian Process Regression surrogate model is developed to map the process to property descriptors of the micro structure morphology.

Best process that gives a desired micro structure is achieved using Bayesian Optimization.
